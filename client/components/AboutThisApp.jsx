            <p style={{fontSize: 15}}>This hotel and flight search app integrates the Skyscanner and Google Maps APIs to help you find the best deals on flights and accommodations worldwide.
                It uses a CI/CD pipeline via GitHub and is deployed on two separate EC2 instancesâ€”one hosting the React-based frontend, and the other running the Java-based backend for handling API requests.
                Any changes pushed to the repository are automatically deployed, keeping the app up to date in real time.
